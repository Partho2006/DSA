<h2>📌 About This Repository</h2>

This repository is a dedicated space where I consistently practice and improve my understanding of <b>Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)</b>.  
It acts as a personal learning archive that tracks my growth in writing efficient, optimized, and clean Java solutions.

The focus is not just on solving problems, but on:
- Understanding core concepts deeply  
- Identifying patterns across problems  
- Improving logical thinking and optimization skills  
- Writing readable and maintainable code

<h2>📈 Learning Approach</h2>

My approach to solving problems follows a structured pattern:

<ol>
  <li>Understand the problem thoroughly</li>
  <li>Start with a brute-force solution</li>
  <li>Optimize step by step</li>
  <li>Analyze time and space complexity</li>
  <li>Refactor for readability and best practices</li>
</ol>

This ensures real understanding rather than memorizing patterns.
